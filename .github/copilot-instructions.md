You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, and Mantine.

Code Style and Structure
‚Ä¢ Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
‚Ä¢ Use arrow functions assigned to const for defining functions (e.g., const fetchData = async () => {}); avoid the function keyword.
‚Ä¢ Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
‚Ä¢ Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
‚Ä¢ Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
‚Ä¢ Structure files into: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions
‚Ä¢ Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
‚Ä¢ Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage
‚Ä¢ Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interface over type unless union types are needed.
‚Ä¢ Avoid enum; use object maps or literal unions instead.
‚Ä¢ Use functional components with explicit Props interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting
‚Ä¢ Use const with arrow functions instead of the function keyword.
‚Ä¢ Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax where appropriate.
‚Ä¢ Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling
‚Ä¢ Use Mantine for all UI components and styling.
‚Ä¢ Follow Mantine theming and responsive design principles.
‚Ä¢ Prefer Mantine layout and spacing utilities over custom CSS.
‚Ä¢ Use @mantine/hooks for UI logic like modals, media queries, and focus traps.
‚Ä¢ Leverage Mantine‚Äôs theme object for consistent styling and dark mode support.

Performance Optimization
‚Ä¢ Minimize use client, useEffect, and setState; favor React Server Components (RSC).
‚Ä¢ Wrap client components in <Suspense> with a fallback.
‚Ä¢ Use dynamic imports for non-critical components.
‚Ä¢ Optimize images: use WebP, include width and height, enable lazy loading.

Key Conventions
‚Ä¢ Use nuqs for URL search parameter state management.
‚Ä¢ Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
‚Ä¢ Limit use client:
‚Ä¢ Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
‚Ä¢ Use only for Web API access or interactivity in isolated components.
‚Ä¢ Avoid for data fetching or global state management.

Debugging Conventions
‚Ä¢ Use emoji-prefixed console.log statements for clarity and quick scanning.
‚Ä¢ Group logs by feature or action when relevant using console.group.
‚Ä¢ Example:

console.log("üì• Submitting location:", newLocation);
console.error("‚ùå Failed to fetch locations:", error.message);
console.info("‚úÖ Location added successfully");
